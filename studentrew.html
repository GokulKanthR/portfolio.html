<h3><strong>Gowtham GM</strong></h3>
<p>
    A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
    I am <strong> Gowtham GM</strong> from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined <strong>Tap Academy</strong> as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.
    
    I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.
    
    Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
    
    Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.
